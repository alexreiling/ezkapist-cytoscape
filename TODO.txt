interface for nodes:

on init cytoscape:
- foreach node init controller
 - dictionary: node type => controller

controller handles:
- creation of Cytoscape node (factory? constructor?)
- addition (with optional subtype, e.g. param, response, prompt etc.), deletion of subnodes
- instantiation of audio nodes
- connection of audio nodes 
- play, pause, setParams
- HANDLE Function

AudioNode structure:
- Each AudioNode is represented by 1 AudioNodeParentController, 1 AudioNodeChannelController for each input/output and 1 parameter connector
- each input/output needs a data prop specifying 
audioNode process:
- set AudioContext on core scratch (context created externally)
- consider: creating new AudioContext if non is provided?
- instantiate all audioNodes AudioNodeParent

controller gets stored in scratch as "ezkapist-node-controller"

handle audioContext and AudioNode instantiation and connection
run flow with and without instantiated audioContext 

nodes in audio graph get prefixed with audio-
nodes in flow graph get prefixed with flow

store audioctx in cy, reference it in scratch in nodes,
check if nulling audioContext in cy null audio in nodes
